I examined the dataset and resolved a few issues, such as eliminating 
incorrect data and creating new characteristics based on existing data. 
The majority of the variables in the dataset were studied and got 
amazing findings, and a few observations were made by comparing 
them to one another. Many potential associations may have remained 
undiscovered because this was simply an exploratory research. More 
extensive statistical analysis of the data should be performed in order 
to uncover new insights and correlations.
